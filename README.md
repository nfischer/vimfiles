My Vim Config
=============

Feel free to use what you like.

This claims compatibility on Ubuntu and Windows 7, across both vim 7.4+ and
[neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim). Realistically, I don't use Windows
very much anymore, so don't be surprised if it's not at 100%. If you find any
bugs, [let me know](https://github.com/nfischer/vimfiles/issues/new) and I'll
try to fix them swiftly.
