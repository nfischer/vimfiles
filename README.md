# My Vim Config

Feel free to use what you like. This is my personal configuration though, so I
don't recommend you use this repo directly (I add tons of breaking changes).

## Compatibility (guaranteed)

 - running within tmux 2.2+
 - vim 8.0+ or nvim 2.0+
 - Ubuntu

I'd like to improve compatibility for the following systems:

 - Windows and OS X (should be mostly there)
 - Older versions of vim (compatible with Raspberry Pi)
 - Older versions of tmux (compatible with Raspberry Pi)

## Bugs :bug:

If you find any bugs, [please let me
know](https://github.com/nfischer/vimfiles/issues/new) and I'll try to fix them
swiftly.
