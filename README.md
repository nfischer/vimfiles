My Vim Config
=============

Feel free to use what you like.

Compatibility:

 - gvim & terminal vim
 - vim 7.4+ & neovim
 - Windows & Ubuntu

Realistically, I don't use Windows very much anymore, so don't be surprised if
it's not at 100%. If you find any bugs, [let me
know](https://github.com/nfischer/vimfiles/issues/new) and I'll try to fix them
swiftly.
